# HMO_Analysis_IST687
Data Science Project work

The	overall	goal	of	the	case	is	to	provide	actionable	insight,	based	on	the	data	available,	as	
well	as	accurately	predict	which	people	(customers) will	be	expensive.
The	dataset	contains	healthcare cost	information from	an	HMO	(Health	Management	
Organization). Each row	in	the	dataset	represents a	person.	
Your	team’s	goal	is	to	understand	the key	drivers	for	why	some	people	are	more	expensive	
(i.e.,	require	more	health	care),	as	well	as	predict	which	people	will	be expensive	(in	terms	
of	health	care	costs).	
Hence,	at	a	high	level,	you	have	two	goals:
• Predict	people	who	will	spend	a	lot	of	money	on	health	care	next	year	(i.e.,	which	
people	will	have	high	healthcare	costs).	
• Provide	actionable	insight	to	the	HMO,	in	terms	of	how	to	lower	their	total	health	
care	costs,	by	providing	a	specific	recommendation	on	how	to	lower	health	care	
costs
